            All websites strive to accomplish a task, or fulfill a need.
            During our discovery process, we get to know eachother.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does your company do? What are your customers hoping to 
            accomplish on your website? What are YOU hoping to accomplish?
            Do you have a favorite color? Did you draw a prototype on a napkin?
            Perhaps there's a website out there you'd like to emulate?
        </p>
        <p>
            The better we understand you, your company, and your customers,
            the better we can serve your website needs.

            Our Background
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sanity Forgotten is run by one intrepid programmer 
            based on Long Island, NY. 
            I've graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Programming and 
            Information Systems from Farmingdale State College in 2012.
            I'll be happy to provide my full name in an E-mail. 
            Sorry for the mysteriousness,
            I take my security, and your website's security seriously.

        <h2>Application Security</h2>
        <p>The way you do one thing, is the way you do everything. I will hold 
            my dealings with you in strict confidentiality. While building the 
            interactive portions of your application, I take on the role of 
            attacker during testing.</p>

        <p>In the end, when we're done playing 'How can I break this?' 
            We'll know that your application is built securely.</p>
